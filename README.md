## Garden Nerd : Flower Recognition Data Science Competition [HackerEarth]

The application of deep learning is rapidly growing in the field of computer vision
and is helping in building powerful classification and identification models.
We can leverage this power of deep learning to build models that can classify
and differentiate between different species of flower as well.
